===============================
### How to play:
 - Goal of the game is to __NOT__ be touched by the bugs and get to the water
 - Every 3 levels you map score will increase
 - Every 10 levels the number of enemy's increases by 1
 - If you die you lose some score
 - Gems:
    - Orange: 500 points and invulnerable for a random amount of time 1-10 sec
    - Green: Extra life
    - Blue: 200 points and speed modifier (slow or fast ...is quite a gamble) for a random amount of time 1-10 sec
